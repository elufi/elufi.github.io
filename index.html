    <h3>Gaming</h3>
    <p>I play games on my PC such as Roblox and Overwatch. Recently, I played a new game with my little brother called Peak. I usually play multiplayer games with friends.</p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>I read a mix of fiction, fantasy, and Sci-Fi. My current favorites include The Phone Booth at the Edge of the World, The Will of the Many, and Legendborn.</p>
    <h3>Cooking</h3>
    <p>When I have time outside of my classes, I like to cook sometimes! Though my palate may be a bit boring, because my favorite food is spaghetti still... </p>
    <h3>Hiking</h3>
    <p>I love exploring new trails. Ideally, I'd live somewhere with lots of nature and mountains nearby. I love the fresh air and the beauty of nature.</p>
